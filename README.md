# Storys-from-Antoher-World
----
Here you will find stories of all kinds that I write in my spare time. The stories are sorted by language. There are no regular dates or similar.
If you want to use my stories further, I would be glad if you put me as a reference, or at least this repository. The stories are all written in Markdown (.md), so they can be read directly in Github and generally on the web.

I hope you enjoy reading them, and if you have any ideas please create an issue and I will try to address it.
